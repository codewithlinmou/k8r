Paving the way for open agents and k8r for all.
Making the development of autonomous human-like agents accessible to all
OpenAGI aims to make human-like agents accessible to everyone, thereby paving the way towards open agents and, eventually, AGI for everyone. We strongly believe in the transformative power of AI and are confident that this initiative will significantly contribute to solving many real-life problems. Currently, OpenAGI is designed to offer developers a framework for creating autonomous human-like agents.
